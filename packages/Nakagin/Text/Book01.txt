<P>The Nakagin Capsule Tower stands as a testament to the Metabolist architectural movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Designed by Kisho Kurokawa and completed in 1972, the building is composed of 140 prefabricated capsules, which were bolted onto two central shafts. These capsules were intended to be replaced or updated every 25 years, allowing the structure to evolve with changing needs and technology. Each capsule is self-contained, and features a flexible living space, bathroom, and kitchenette, embodying a futuristic vision of modular living.
